mitsuba (0.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is mainly a bugfix release to address a serious regression in the 
  material system. Other notable changes are: 

  * Imported scenes now store relative paths
  * OBJ importing works on Windows
  * Realtime preview (OpenGL + RTRT) fixed for point sources
  * The anisotropic Ward BRDF is now supported in the preview
  * Faster texture loading
  * The renderer now has a testcase framework similar to JUnit

mitsuba (0.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Numerous bugfixes
  * Vastly improved COLLADA importer
  * Basic user interface for running the importer
  * Support for environment sources in the realtime preview
  * When pressing the stop button while rendering, the partially rendered
    scene now remains on the screen. Pressing the stop button a second time
    switches back to the realtime preview.
  * The user interface now has a fallback mode when the graphics card
    is lacking some required OpenGL features.
  * Create default cameras/lightsources if none are specified in a scene
  * Support for drag & drop in the user interface
  * The Mitsuba user interface now also doubles as an EXR viewer / tonemapper. 
    Drag an EXR file onto the UI or open it using the File menu, and the image 
    opens in a new tab. Afterwards, it is possible to export the image as a tonemapped
    8-bit PNG image.
  * The realtime preview now has a 'force diffuse' feature to improve
    convergence in scenes with lots of glossy materials.
  * Two different navigation modes can now be chosen in the program settings
  * New material types: composite, difftrans, transparent, mask.
  * ldrtexture: support for loading BMP and TGA images.
  * Switch to Xerces-C++ 3
