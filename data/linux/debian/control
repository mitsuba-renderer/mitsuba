Description: physically-based renderer
 Mitsuba is an extensible rendering framework written in portable C++. It 
 implements unbiased as well as biased techniques and contains heavy 
 optimizations targeted towards current CPU architectures. 
 .
 The program currently runs on Linux, MacOS X and Microsoft Windows and makes 
 use of SSE2 optimizations on x86 and x86_64 platforms. So far, its main use 
 has been as a testbed for algorithm development in computer graphics, but 
 there are many other interesting applications.
