The architecture of Mitsuba as well as some individual components are based on implementations discussed in: \emph{Physically Based Rendering - From Theory To Implementation} by Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys.
The architecture of the coherent path tracer traversal code was influenced by Radius from Thierry Berger-Perrin.
Many thanks go to my advisor Steve Marschner, who let me spend time on this project.
Some of the GUI icons were taken from the Humanity icon set by Canonical Ltd.
The material test scene was created by Jonas Pilo, and the environment map
it uses is courtesy of Bernhard Vogl.

The included index of refraction data files for conductors are copied from
PBRT. They are originally from the Luxpop database (\url{www.luxpop.com}) 
and are based on data by Palik et al. \cite{Palik1998Handbook}
and measurements of atomic scattering factors made by the Center For
X-Ray Optics (CXRO) at Berkeley and the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory (LLNL).
