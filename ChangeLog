	* converter.cpp: Much better import of COLLADA scenes from
		blender.

	* importdlg.cpp: User interface for importing scenes.

2010-08-09  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* rendersettingsdlg.cpp: Try to maintain the number of 
		samples/pixel when switching between different samplers.

2010-08-05  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>
	
	* constant.cpp, src/libhw/vpl.cpp: Support for image environment 
		sources and spot lights in the real-time preview.

2010-08-03  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* mitsuba.cpp: Ability to run the 'mitsuba' execubable in arbitrary
		locations on OSX while ensuring that it still finds all plugins etc.

	* mtsimport: COLLADA importer support for ambient lights and 'polylist' meshes.

	* scene.cpp: Create a default camera when none is specified in the XML file.

	* constant.cpp, src/libhw/vpl.cpp: Support for rendering constant environment 
		sources in the real-time preview.

2010-07-21  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* glwidget.cpp, mainwindow.cpp: Support for Drag & Drop

	* glwidget.cpp, mainwindow.cpp: The Mitsuba user interface now also
		doubles as an EXR viewer / tonemapper. Drag an EXR file onto the
		UI or open it using the File menu, and the image opens in a new
		tab. Afterwards, it is possible to export the image as a tonemapped
		8-bit PNG image.

2010-07-19  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* include/mitsuba/mitsuba.h: First semi-official external release 0.1.1

	* rendersettingsdlg.cpp: Perform a sanity check when changing the rendering
		settings: if the configuration doesn't make any sense, prevent the 
		user from continuing.

	* mainwindow.cpp, many others: Numerous bugfixes for all platforms

2010-07-18  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* previewsettingsdlg_cocoa_impl.mm: When running on OSX, use a
		Cocoa-based settings tweaker using a 'HUD Layout' instead of 
		the Qt version.
	
	* debian/*: Finished debian package support
	
	* glwidget.cpp: Fixed some crashes

2010-07-17  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* preview.cpp: Many bugfixes for standard ray tracing. The partial
		preview shown while moving through the scene now adapts to its 
		complexity, making the interaction smoother.

	* preview.cpp: Support for coherent ray tracing -- about 2-4x 
		faster than standard ray tracing.

	* glwidget.cpp: When rendering very complex scenes, it was possible
		that the UI required a long time to acquire a image containing
		the most recent preview. This part is now allowed to time out 
		gracefully, leading to a more responsive user interface.

	* mainwindow.cpp: "Resize to Fit" menu action. 

	* mainwindow.cpp: Open/Save dialogs now remember their position,
		layout and directory.

	* debian/*: Support for generating Debian/Ubuntu packages

2010-07-15  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* preview.cpp: Very basic support for rendering the preview using 
		standard ray tracing. 

2010-07-14  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* errctrl.cpp: Added a feature that enables the error-controlling
		integrator to switch between an image-wide and a per-pixel based
		error criterion.

	* glwidget.cpp, mainwindow.cpp, previewsettingsdlg.cpp: Added support 
		for the tonemapping technique by Reinhard et al. from 2002. It
		dynamically adapts to the average luminance in the viewport.

2010-07-13  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* xmltreemodel.cpp: When showing the integrator/sampler/film properties
		in the render setting editor, the less important ones are now drawn
		using a light grey color.

	* triangle.cpp: Fixed a numerical issue when primitive clipping/
		perfect splits were active while building the kd-tree -- in some 
		rare cases, this could result in missing geometry.

	* glwidget.cpp, preview.cpp: Nicer behavior when switching tabs.
		Previously, the preview would regenerate from scratch, which caused
		unpleasant flicker. Now, the preview stores the complete state just
		before switching away, and this is used to resume when switching
		back to the tab.

	* sceneloader.cpp, mainwindow.cpp: The interactive preview now tries
		to detect the path length from the current scene configuration.
	
	* rendersettingsdlg.cpp, save.cpp: It is now possible to configure the
		adaptive integrator & irradiance cache from within the GUI.

2010-07-11  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* mainwindow.cpp: Added a 'clone tab' feature, which is accessible
		in the File menu and using a context menu on the tabs

	* many files: Changed the system how scenes are transmitted over the 
		network. The camera and integrator are now serialized separately and 
		reattached to a shallow scene copy on the remote side. This makes it 
		possible to render a scene from multiple viewpoints & using different 
		techniques, while not having to send the (potentially large) scene 
		over the wire every time.

2010-07-10  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* mainwindow.cpp: Added a feature to export images (preview+rendered)
		from within the user interface.

	* glwidget.cpp: Better-behaved UI when rendering tiny images (e.g. 100x100).
		The app now has a specified minimum size; smaller images will be 
		surrounded by gray margins and frame highlights the image dimensions.

	* mainwindow.cpp, glwidget.cpp: Better-behaved UI when rendering huge 
		images. When the image does not fit on the screen, scroll bars appear. 
		Scrolling is supported using either two-finger gestures (OSX), the 
		mouse scroll wheel or by using the scroll bars themselves.

	* mainwindow.cpp, glwidget.cpp: Got rid of numerous sources of flickering 
		when switching between tabs. To make it all work, the OSX version now 
		requires Qt 4.7.x (tech preview 2) or higher.

	* glwidget.cpp: The field of view can now be changed using the right
		mouse button. It is also possible to move within the film plane using 
		the middle mouse button.

2010-07-08  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* path.h, path.cpp, pathvertex.h, pathvertex.cpp: Reorganized path related 
		code, switched away from the purely inline-based header files.

	* save.cpp: The save feature now stores changes to the integrator, sampler
		and image reconstruction filter. The XML output has been made much 
		more readable.

2010-07-07  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>

	* mainwindow.cpp [OSX]: Detect crash reports and submit them
		over the web. This is only supported on OSX for now, since the
		other platforms don't collect them in a suitable way.

	* renderjob.cpp: Fix for the missing plugin crashes on Steve's machine

	* bidir_proc.cpp: Corrected sample positions for BDPT, which caused
		grid-like artifacts when rendering with the box filter.

	* path.h, mlt_*.cpp: Consolidated lots of repeated code into a new
		PathVertex::connect() function.

2010-07-07  Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@cs.cornell.edu>
	* ChangeLog: starting to keep a change log of notable changes (it
		won't contain minor edits).
